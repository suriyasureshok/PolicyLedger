# PolicyLedger

*A Google Cloud–native, fallback-safe RL Policy Marketplace*

## 📌 Problem

Reinforcement learning agents train at the edge but lack trust in policy submissions. Verifying policies without retraining is computationally expensive, and no marketplace exists for RL policies due to the inability to verify claimed rewards.

## 🚀 Solution

PolicyLedger learns at the edge, verifies in the cloud, remembers immutably, and reuses intelligence. Decentralized RL agents submit policies to a marketplace where they are verified through deterministic replay, stored in a tamper-evident ledger, and made available for reuse by consumers.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Summary

**PolicyLedger** operates through a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Edge Learning**: RL agents (running on edge devices like old phones/laptops) train independently using tabular Q-learning in a shared deterministic environment (`EnergySlotEnv`).

2. **Policy Submission**: Agents submit trained policies with claimed rewards to a submission layer (Firebase REST API or local queue).

3. **Cloud Verification**: Vertex AI custom jobs verify policies by deterministically replaying them in the same environment and recomputing rewards. Invalid claims are rejected.

4. **Immutable Ledger**: Verified policies are stored in a Firestore append-only collection (hash-chained entries) forming a tamper-evident ledger.

5. **Marketplace Ranking**: Cloud Functions trigger on new ledger entries and rank policies by verified reward, updating the best policy reference.

6. **Policy Reuse**: Consumers fetch the best policy from the marketplace and run it immediately without retraining, demonstrating intelligent reuse.

7. **Explainability** (optional): Gemini API generates human-readable explanations of why winning policies work.

## ☁️ Google Services Used

- **Firebase/Firestore**: Policy submission endpoints and append-only ledger with immutability rules
- **Vertex AI**: Custom jobs for deterministic policy verification and reward recomputation
- **Cloud Functions**: Event-driven marketplace updates triggered by new ledger entries
- **TensorFlow/TensorFlow Lite**: Agent training and policy export for edge deployment
- **Gemini API**: AI-generated explanations of policy strategies (optional)

**Fallback Strategy**: Every Google service has a local Python/JSON fallback to ensure the system works fully offline.

Each module exposes **interfaces**, not concrete logic, ensuring modularity.

## 🎯 Demo Environment

**EnergySlotEnv**: A deterministic energy scheduling environment where agents manage battery charge/discharge over 24 discrete time steps. The environment uses seeded randomness to ensure reproducibility — same seed produces identical trajectories.

**RL Type**: Tabular Q-learning with discrete state/action spaces  
**Actions**: `{SAVE, USE}` (save energy to battery or use from battery)  
**Reward**: Based on efficient energy utilization given deterministic demand patterns

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Python**: 3.10+
- **Google Cloud Account** (optional, for cloud features)
- **Edge Hardware**: Old phone or laptop for agent demonstration

Install dependencies:
```bash
# For cloud-native mode
pip install -r requirements-cloud.txt

# For local fallback mode
pip install -r requirements-local.txt
```

## 🚦 Quick Start

### 1. Train an Agent (Edge)
```bash
python agent/train.py --agent-id agent_A --episodes 1000
```

### 2. Submit Policy
```bash
python agent/submit.py --agent-id agent_A --policy output/policy_A.pkl
```

### 3. Verify Policy (Cloud/Local)
```bash
python verifier/verify.py --policy-hash <hash>
```

### 4. Query Marketplace
```bash
python marketplace/query.py --top 5
```

### 5. Reuse Best Policy (Consumer)
```bash
python consumer/run.py --policy-id <best_policy_hash>
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Complete Demo

```bash
# Clean slate
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force policies -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item demo_ledger.json -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
